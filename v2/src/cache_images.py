"""
Optional one-time speed-up: pre-decode every DICOM into a PNG cache before
launching the 8 parallel training runs. UnifespDataset already caches
lazily on first read (see dataset.py's load_cached_or_decode), so this
script isn't required for correctness -- it just avoids every one of the
first 2 (parallel) backbones redundantly decoding the same ~1700 training
images during their first epoch. Top Kaggle finishers on this exact
competition reported DICOM decoding as their biggest bottleneck.

Kaggle usage, right after environment setup, before Step 2 training:
    python -m src.cache_images
